## Data Files

The dashboard uses two main CSV files located in the `public` directory:

1. **2025-10-24T12_17_08.377Z-profitability.csv** - Complete profitability report with all loads
   - Load numbers
   - Revenue and profit data

2. **AIM TRUCK OTR - COMPLETED RUNS.csv** - OTR-specific load tracking
   - AIM reference numbers
   - Delivery locations
   - Customer information
   - OTR margins

The dashboard automatically cross-references these files using the Load # and AIM REFERENCE NUMBER fields to separate OTR from Local Drayage operations.
